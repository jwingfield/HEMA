For those of you that know us, you may have noticed that we've not been around much lately.  There are a number of reasons for this, but ultimately we have decided to call it a day.  This wasn't an easy decision, but things had to change.  

I started my new job in February, with the intention that we would still sell at some of the bigger fairs and those close to home.  After a few months it became clear that this wasn't going to work as I was effectively working 7 days a week.  We're missing the friends that we've made over the years, though it's great to be able to take things a little slower.  We're also enjoying having the conservatory, dining room and living room back!

So, we'd like to thank all of you for your custom and friendship over the last 10 years and wish you all the best in the future.
